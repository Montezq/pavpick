Images form the foundation of our software. We have taken years to perfect our photography methods to ensure that what is seen with the physical eye is what is displayed on screen."},{question:"How are the images created? ",answer:"The images are created by photographing individual product samples. This allows us to show any pattern, joint colour and joint size. "},{question:"How many product samples do we need to send you?",answer:"This depends on the type of product such as colour blends and size. Taking multiple photographs ensures realistic blends are achieved and repetition is avoided. We will advise on the number of products to send.

We travel anywhere in the world."}]},hosting:{title:"Hosting",items:[{question:"Can we host it on our own servers?",answer:"In short, no. For security reasons we host the software on our servers. This also allows for updates and maintenance. Additionally, we can remove, add, and alter products as required."},{question:"Which servers do you use?",answer:"Paver Picker software is hosted in an AWS Data Centre. AWS is one of the leading cloud platforms and is used by companies such as Netflix, Facebook and the BBC. AWS provides a very robust platform with high availability and the ability to add additional processing capacity as required."},{question:"How many product samples do we need to send you?",answer:"We have a hardware firewall limiting port access.

We keep your software up to date with frequent maintenance updates to ensure that it is always up to date with the current web standards."},{question:"Where can we use our software?",answer:"New accounts are granted approval to be used on a specific domain name. They will also run independently of a website so that they can be used in store or at exhibitions."},{question:"Can I add a Module?",answer:"Yes, modules can be added at any time."},{question:"Can I add and remove products?",answer:"Yes, once you inform us of which product(s) needs to be removed, we will make the update for you.
